<img src="gd_utils_logo.png" alt="Logo" width="200" height="200">

A collection of Python utility functions that I always found myself rewriting.
This repository aims to provide a centralized and readily available set of common functions to avoid redundant code across projects.

## 💬 Description

This repo contains various Python utility functions designed to simplify common tasks. 
Instead of rewriting these functions in every project, you can simply import and use them from this library.  The goal is to improve code reusability, consistency, and save development time.

### 📦 Features
- 🛠️🖼️ Image/Tensor preprocessing utilities
- ⏱️⏳ Timing functions similar to Matlab's `tic` and `toc`
- 📸📊 Image display utilities

## ⚙️ Installation
For now, you can just copy+paste the code snippets.
I will be working on making this into a pip package.
